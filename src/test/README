Unit tests for zCall/src

Author: Iain Bancarz, ib5@sanger.ac.uk

Tests should be run from the src subdirectory of the zCall source code, as cloned from Github.  They are run by simply executing test/test.py with Python 2.7.

The tests require a correctly populated 'bigdata' directory, specified in etc/config.ini.  Bigdata contains test files too large to upload to github.  Contents should include:
- GTC files with intensities and genotype calls
- EGT file: Expected to be HumanExome-12v1.egt, available from http://support.illumina.com/downloads.ilmn. Should be the file corresponding to the GTC test data.
- BPM file: A .bpm.csv file corresponding to the EGT file and manifest for the GTC files.
- thresholds.txt files: Generated from the EGT file, for z scores (6, 7, 8).
- thresholds.json file: A .json file containing a dictionary whose keys are (string) z scores, and values are paths to the corresponding threshold.txt files in bigdata.

Appropriate thresholds .txt and .json files can be generated by running test.py.  The files will appear in the output directory from test_prepareThresholds, which will be of the form 'data/tmp*'. The test.py script includes hard-coded checksums to ensure that the generated thresholds.txt files are correct.

After generation, threshold files can be copied to bigdata. Paths in the .json file should be edited to point to the bigdata threshold .txt files.  Other tests will fail if the threshold files are not in the specified bigdata directory.
