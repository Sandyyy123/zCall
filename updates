Updates:

May 8th, 2012:

1. Fixed scripts to account for sites where <= 2 points were assigned to both homozygote clusters.

2. Set default AutoCall PED file (Version 1) to output A/B alleles rather than A,T,G,C alleles so that the output of all three versions is standard. This also avoids differences in reference strand used when comparing calls across sites. To revert back to outputting A,T,G,C alleles, look at zCall.py and uncomment/comment the specified lines.

3. Updated input GenomeStudio report format (Version 2 & 3) to include the chromosome and position in order to avoid using the probe manifest file. The input should now resemble the following:

Name<tab>Chr<tab>Position<tab>Sample1.GType<tab>Sample1.X<tab>Sample1.Y
rs000001<tab>1<tab>900001<tab>NC<tab>0.0000<tab>0.0000

This affects the input parameters to convertReportToTPED.py and zCall.py

May 21st, 2012:

1. Added a minimum signal intensity threshold filter for No Calls in the findThresholds.py script with the -I flag. Default is 0.2. To recall all sites, use -I 0.0

June 21st, 2012:

1. There is an error in the README for Versions 2 and 3. The example usage for the calibrateZ.py script should read:

python calibrateZ.py -R my.report -T my.thresholds -E my.egt > my.concordance.stats
